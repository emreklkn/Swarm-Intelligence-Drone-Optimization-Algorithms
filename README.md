# Swarm-Based Drone Targeting Algorithms

This repository contains Python-based simulation implementations of various **nature-inspired optimization algorithms** applied to autonomous drone targeting problems.

Each algorithm simulates a swarm of drones attempting to reach and neutralize a target in 2D space, using their own movement rules and collective intelligence.

Implemented algorithms:

- ✅ **Baseline** (Straight-forward greedy movement)
- ✅ **PSO** (Particle Swarm Optimization)
- ✅ **LGPSO** (Linearly-adjusted PSO with velocity boost)
- ✅ **ACO** (Ant Colony Optimization - simulated via pheromone trails)
- ✅ **ABC** (Artificial Bee Colony)
- ✅ **FA** (Firefly Algorithm)
- ✅ **GWO** (Grey Wolf Optimizer)
- ✅ **BAT** (Bat Algorithm)
- ✅ **DO** (Dandelion Optimizer)
- ✅ **SOS** (Satin Optimization Strategy)

Each model uses visual feedback through matplotlib animation and calculates impact accuracy at the end of simulation.
